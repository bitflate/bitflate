Bitflate
=====================================

What is Bitflate?
----------------

Bitflate is a Bitcoin-based crypto currency. The project is in experimental stage.
The main differentiation of Bitflate is inflation.

The goal is to create a stable crypto currency, stable coin through inflation.

By adding inflation, we can:

- Prevent price from fluctuating wildly.
- Discourage HODL behavior, increase liquidity.

Bitflate is not a Store of Value.

Technical
-------

Bitflate is based on Bitcoin. It has the following differences:

- It creates 10.5 million coins in the first halving.
- In subsequent halvings, coins inflate 7%. At this inflation rate, coin supply doubles every 10 years.
- Proof of Work timespan is 3.5 days. We want 1-year halving interval.

FAQ
-------

#### Why do you want to have inflation?

Bitcoin has fixed supply. The currency is deflationary. It causes price to fluctuate wildly. We think it is a good Store of Value (SoV). But for transactions, price fluctuation is a problem.

Existing stable coins are typically implemented through bank ledger. This requires 3rd party centralized banks. We want to create a stable coin through inflation. We think inflation would add liquidity to Bitflate currency.

#### Why Bitflate inflation rate is 7%?

We take the reverse-Bitcoin approach of setting inflation rate fairly high. If we set the rate low, the currency may behave just like Bitcoin.

If this coin ever receives widespread adoption, high inflation can meet market demand.

We pick the rate of 7% from Rule 72. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_72

Coin supply doubles every 10 years.
