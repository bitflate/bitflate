Bitflate
=====================================

What is Bitflate?
----------------

Bitflate is a Bitcoin-based crypto currency. The project is in experimental stage.
The main differentiation of Bitflate is inflation.

The goal is to create a stable crypto currency, stable coin through inflation.

By adding inflation, we can:

- Prevent price from rising.
- Discourage HODL behavior.

Bitflate is not a Store of Value.

Technical
-------

Bitflate is based on Bitcoin. It has the following differences:

- It creates 10.5 million coins in the first halving.
- In subsequent halvings, coins inflate 7%.
- Proof of Work timespan is 3.5 days. We want 1-year halving interval.
